# About me

<div style={{ fontWeight: "600" }}>
  Hi! I’m Erez – a Computer Science student with a minor in Data Science and AI,
  and a knack for full-stack development. I love tackling challenges, learning
  new skills, and turning ideas into reality. I’m passionate about crafting
  clean, intuitive interfaces and writing code that just works. Curious,
  open-minded, and detail-oriented, I enjoy collaborating with others and
  constantly pushing my boundaries in tech. I ❤️ coding and have a passion for
  everything related to it.
